# WyyMusicConvertGui

## The NCM format file conversion to MP3 tool is built using WPF and is currently in the demo stage.

##  Some takeaways: 
Both WPF and WinForms are quite outdated. Although I have written single-page applications before, 
I haven't delved deeply into them. This time, my attempt at writing multi-page native navigation was quite unsuccessful, 
and I couldn't find a good solution through searching. I should look for mature and usable UI frameworks. Next, 
I plan to try writing some applications using WinUI 3.
